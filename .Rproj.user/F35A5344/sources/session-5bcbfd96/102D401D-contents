## Final Reflection

I am happy to write this final reflection at the end of the semester, because I am satisfied with what I have achieved in less than three months. I still remember that when I was going to start this course, I felt very confused when seeing so much content. I was only familiar with Python before: although I had heard my undergraduate teacher mention the use of R in statistics, I did not know more than the assignment statement and creating vectors. Before this class, I had no clear understanding about statistics either: the only thing I knew about Bayesian was Bayes' Rule, and for the exams I simply repeated the "null ritual" without knowing why we needed to do that.

This semester has been challenging for me, not only because of this course: actually, the flexibility of this course has helped me manage my time better: I spent about five or six weeks learning all the entries listed in the map. This was time-consuming at the start of this semester, but later allowed me to decide my project with a clear mind and to spend more time on so many assignments of other courses. I don't know if it is better to have lectures, but I would say that I really like the map because it forces me to build a structure in my mind. I only went to watch the lectures of the last year when I was really confused. 

Just like when someone first starts learning any programming language, at first I had difficulties remembering the R grammar, as it is pretty different from Python (actually, things like "group_by" are similar, but I was not familiar with data analysis operations in Python either...) . Apart from practising R grammar by imitating the code on the website, I have managed to build a mind map with my laptop, which not only has helped me to have a better overall understanding of the course content, but will also be useful as reference when I need to use R later.

I decided the topic of my project in Week 7. As I had completed all the entries available at that time and had practised through the challenge of regressions, I preferred to find a topic that requires the use of a Bayesian regression model, because it seemed more meaningful and advanced. I combined the dataset in WALS and PHOIBLE, and although at first I thought it could be not so satisfying to choose things with "low" difficulty, I was wrong. My project turns out to be more advanced and challenging as I thought before, because when I chose the topic I had not realised that the model required in the context is more complicated that what I had learnt. In my model, the outcome is categorical and the predictor is numeric (and it also includes categorical interactive predictor), which is not covered in this course. It was also hard for me to wrangle the data at the first time, because I had only heard about merging data frames in SQL then, but I did not know SQL at all.

To complete my project, I have learnt many things not covered in this course independently. Besides the data wrangling, which only costed me two days to make it, I have had trouble with the model type and made many modifications in that part. In week 11, I had basically completed several separate scripts; before starting with a complete quarto file, I decided to doublecheck with the instructor and posted a question on piazza. I asked about whether multinomial logistic regression was an appropriate choice for a model with categorical outcome and numeric predictors. Stefano replied me quickly and recommended a paper, which is really helpful. However, after reading the paper and the new entry "regression models: a cheat sheet", I suddenly realised that maybe the model is not the best for my question: it is true that the outcome in my model is categorical, but I did not mention in the question that my categorical outcome is actually in certain order: "simple", "moderately complex" and "complex", and thus multinomial regression is not suitable because it requires not ordinal variables. However, it is not reasonable either to say that the syllable structure complexity categories are ordinal because they are not quantifiable scales. After searching a lot on the Internet and reading an online stat course of Pennsylvania State University, I chose the adjacent category model and found the results more meaningful.

As a student majoring in language (even not linguistics, I really hope that I could learn linguistics in undergraduate before I came here...) in undergraduate, I was quite unfamiliar with useful tools. I was really confused when I read the entry about Quarto in the first week, but now, I am quite comfortable with it. As I have made my plots interactive, which cannot be rendered in a PDF, I managed to load my html file on GitHub to keep my interactive plots available. I have no experience of this before, and I didn't imagine that, apart from improve my R skills and statistical understanding, I can gain some practical skills apart from my topic.

To assign myself a mark, I would choose the A2 band. Like the description, I have learnt all of the minimum contents plus further contents in the Notebook (actually when I completed the entries about regressions, all the entries were in the same colour, and I didn't even know that some of them are mandatory while others are not) and other sources when I was working on my project. I think that I have met the description of "analysing data in contexts that are very dissimilar from the ones seen in class" and "using advanced regression models and possibly other methods": when I used the adjacent categorical model in my project, as such models always require a baseline category, making it impossible to use index coding directly, I found it troublesome to interpret the results; to deal with this problem and make the results more straightforward, I learnt to use dummy variables to estimate the effects for each macroarea independently. However, I cannot say that I have achieved this mark band satisfactorily, as the plots shown in my project may not be complex enough (although they are interactive, I think it is pretty easy to just make plots interactive...). In conclusion, I would give myself an 82, for all the work I have put in this semester.

At the end of my reflection, I hope that in the future I will have more opportunities to put R skills in practice. Although I have worked hard and learnt a lot in this semesters, I am far from skilled with only 11 weeks. I hope that I will never forget what I have learnt in this class, whether it is R skills or Bayesian statistics. I will not repeat the null ritual when I start on my own research: this is the biggest impact this course has on my cognition!
